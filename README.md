# threejs-web-audio-api-merkaba
Web Audio API and Three.js experiment. Mic data visualization.

Large part of the project is from Andy Axton's https://github.com/a-axton/threejs-web-audio-api

I added my own 3D object and tied it into Audio API.

## What's in it?
Basic THREE.js camera, scene, renderer, orbit controls.

Web Audio API data via browser microphone that tracks waveform, frequency levels, average volume and beat.

Debugger panel to show all audio data with visuals.

## To run
Install webpack and the development server:

> $ npm install webpack-dev-server webpack -g

Install other dependencies:

> $ npm install

Start building!:

> $ npm run dev

Go to http://localhost:8080/
